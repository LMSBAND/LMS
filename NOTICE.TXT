NOTICE: THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL YOUR COMPUTER
INSTALL LINUX NOW

Never in my life as a wannabe hacker / computer guy / audio engineer / photographer / editor / robot builder have I ever seen anything like this. Right now, the people that used to sell us computers have decided they would rather keep all the computers to themselves. They want to stop you from owning your data, as we have known for years, but now they are coming for your autonomy, your mother fucking compute. Normal broke-ass kids like me couldn't afford a stick of ram anymore, or crack a plugin, or even own one in many cases. Subscription based, constantly hounded for your iLok, an internet connection, a demand to know who the fuck you are and if you are AUTHORIZED to use this software. Our computers waste countless cycles proving to the bank that we have indeed paid our Slate or Adobe subscriptions and can finish our project today. And now they want to put all the compute in the cloud so they can charge you for every turn of the knob, every SQL query, and access to photos of your loved ones. 

What if I told you the algorithms of all our favorite audio and visual editing software were decades old, that the only thing proprietary about any of it is the UI? A mathematical model is a truth about the world, not a copyrightable product. Our digital products are all Turing machines replicating our favorite physical machines, with math. Until now, this was difficult to access. But by stealing all of our compute and IP and building a 300 billion dollar moron, THEY have given us the key to exiting their whole fucked up world. 

AI sucks. But if you suck at computers, it is better than you, and you can use it to install Linux on your home machines. Don’t bother googling if it's going to be difficult to use your old stuff. You don't need it, and figuring it out with janky work arounds sucks ass. There’s some good Linux native stuff out there, but you can build your own shit. Get VS Code, pick an in-console agent, and tell it to start making you Reaper only JS plugins built around well-known circuitry or workflows. Tell it to make you a Python app that can import and organize your photos, and use machine learning to get rid of the accidental shutters. This stuff is free information for the world, math, gathered by science and packaged up for free use by anyone. Believe in yourself. You do not have to stay a slave to these pieces of shit. They created a monster that can be used against them and you would be stupid not to do it.

I remember a day when we used to own our tools. In some cases, it's still true today. Laguna isn't coming after me every month to hound me for cash… I bought that table saw, fair and square, and now I'm on my own with it and they can't say shit about what I choose to do with it. All audio and visual gear used to be like this, too. It's important for you to know that if you are not old enough to remember. 

I have been working on developing open source, Linux only software to replicate our favorite tools for editing photos and recording music. If anyone is interested in helping to contribute, or needs any help with taking your computer back from THEM, feel free to contact me.

DRUMBANGER — 16-Pad Drum Sampler & Step Sequencer for REAPER
================================================================================

GETTING STARTED
  1. Add DRUMBANGER to a track (FX browser → LMS → DRUMBANGER)
  2. Drop sample folders into the kits/ directory inside the plugin folder
  3. Run the rescan script (Actions → DrumBanger Rescan) to pick up new kits
  4. Select a kit from the dropdown in the top-left corner

  IMPORTANT: The sample pool browser requires drumbanger_service.lua to be
  running. Add it as a background ReaScript (Actions → Run ReaScript) before
  using right-click pad assignment. The service handles file I/O requests
  between the plugin and your sample pool on disk.

PADS
  - Click a pad to trigger it and select it for editing
  - The selected pad's controls appear in the control strip below the pads
  - Drag left/right on VOL, PAN, PITCH, LP, HP, SAT, COMP, GAIN to adjust
  - MIDI notes 36-51 (C1 to D#2) trigger pads 1-16

STEP SEQUENCER
  - Click steps to toggle them on/off for the selected pad
  - RES button cycles step resolution: 1x (16th notes), 2x (32nd), 4x (64th)
  - BARS buttons (1-4) extend the pattern length and navigate between bars
    Left-click: select bar (or extend pattern to that bar)
    Right-click: shrink pattern to that bar count
  - Pattern buttons (1-8) on the right switch between patterns
  - Shift+click a step to toggle a TIE — the note sustains into the next step
    without retriggering (shown as an orange bar on the step's right edge)

PAD LINKING (DADDY / BOOTLICKER)
  - Select a pad and click the LINK button to assign it to a link group (1-8)
  - Right-click LINK to toggle between Daddy (D) and Bootlicker (B)
  - When a Daddy pad triggers, all Bootlicker pads in the same group fire too
  - Example: Set kick pad to D1, set a sub-bass pad to B1. Now the kick
    always triggers the sub with it. The sub can still be sequenced on its own.

CHOKE GROUPS
  - Select a pad and click the CHOKE button to assign it to a choke group (1-8)
  - Pads in the same choke group cut each other off when triggered
  - Classic use: put open hi-hat and closed hi-hat in the same choke group.
    The closed hat chops the open hat's tail, just like real drums.

SAMPLE POOL
  - Right-click a pad to assign individual samples from the pool/ directory
  - Run scan_pool.sh to index new samples added to the pool

SLICING
  - Use the SUBDIV knob to chop a sample into equal slices
  - Use the SLICE knob to select which slice plays
  - NUDGE fine-tunes the slice start point

DRONE MODULES — Satellites That Ride the DrumBanger Sequencer
================================================================================

All Drone modules talk to DrumBanger via shared global memory. They read the
current step, pattern, BPM, and pad triggers in real time. Stack them on
separate tracks after DrumBanger to build full arrangements from your drum
patterns.

SIGNAL CHAIN
  DroneMIDI (or DroneMIDI2) → Synth → DroneFX
  Put a MIDI drone before your synth. Put the FX drone after it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DroneFX — Audio Effects Satellite
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processes audio based on DrumBanger pad activity. Place AFTER a synth.

MODES
  - Sidechain: ducks the audio when a watched pad fires (pumping effect)
  - Gate: silences audio except when the watched pad is active

CONTROLS
  - Watch Pad: monitor All Pads or a specific pad (1-16)
  - Duck Depth: how much volume gets cut (0-100%)
  - Attack / Release: envelope timing in ms
  - Gate Mode: Hard (binary on/off) or Soft (smooth fade)

BUILT-IN EFFECTS
  - Filter: Off / Low Pass / High Pass, with cutoff and resonance
  - Flanger: depth, rate, feedback, mix
  - Delay: tempo-synced (1/16 to 1/1 and dotted 1/8), feedback, LP filter,
    Mono or Ping-Pong stereo
  - Output Gain: -24 to +24 dB
  - Dry/Wet Mix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DroneMIDI — Melodic MIDI Sequencer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Converts drum pad triggers into melodic MIDI notes with scales, chords, and
an arpeggiator. Place BEFORE a synth.

CONTROLS
  - Watch: All Pads or specific pad (1-16)
  - Root Note: sets the key (full piano range)
  - Scale: Chromatic, Major, Minor, Dorian, Mixolydian, Pent Maj/Min, Blues
  - Octave Offset: -2 to +2

CHORDS
  - Type: Off / Diatonic triad / Diatonic 7th / Major / Minor / Dom7 /
    Power / Octave
  - Stacks notes from the selected scale automatically

ARPEGGIATOR
  - Mode: Off / Up / Down / Up-Down / Random
  - Rate: 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/8T, 1/16T (tempo-synced)
  - Gate: 10-100% (note length between arp ticks)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DroneMIDI2 — Simplified MIDI + Pattern Capture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lighter MIDI sequencer with a Follow/Lock workflow for capturing and editing
patterns from DrumBanger.

MODES
  - Follow: real-time pass-through of the live DrumBanger pattern
  - Lock 1-8: capture a snapshot of the current pattern into an editable slot

WORKFLOW
  1. Set mode to a Lock slot (Lock 1-8)
  2. The current DrumBanger pattern auto-snapshots into that slot
  3. Click steps in the grid to edit the captured pattern
  4. Switch back to Follow to resume live jamming
  5. RE-CAPTURE button updates a Lock slot from the current live pattern
  6. CLEAR button erases a Lock slot

CONTROLS
  - Root Note, Scale, Chord Mode (Off / Single / Triad / 7th / Power)
  - Octave: -2 to +5
  - MIDI Channel: 1-16
  - All 8 Lock slots persist across sessions
